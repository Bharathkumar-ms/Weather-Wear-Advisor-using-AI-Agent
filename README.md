## **Weather and Clothing Suggestion Tool**

### **Project Overview**
This project provides:
1. **Real-time weather information** for any location using the OpenWeather API.
2. **Clothing recommendations** based on the weather conditions and temperature.

The application utilizes **LangChain** and **ChatGroq** to create an intelligent and context-aware system capable of generating human-like responses and actionable suggestions.

### **Features**
- **Real-Time Weather Data**: 
  Fetches current weather conditions (e.g., clear, rain, snow) and temperature (°C) for a specified location using the OpenWeather API.
  
- **Clothing Recommendations**: 
  Provides tailored clothing advice based on:
  - **Weather conditions** (e.g., rain → waterproof jacket, snow → heavy coat).
  - **Temperature ranges** (e.g., cold → warm clothing, hot → breathable fabrics).

- **Language Model Integration**:
  Leverages the **LangChain framework** and **ChatGroq LLM** to process user inputs and generate recommendations.

---

### **How It Works**
1. The user inputs a location (e.g., "New York").
2. The **Weather Tool** fetches real-time weather data, including conditions and temperature, using the OpenWeather API.
3. The **Clothing Suggestion Tool** analyzes the weather data and provides clothing recommendations tailored to the conditions and temperature.
4. The system uses **LangChain's zero-shot agent** for efficient task delegation and response generation.

### **Technologies Used**
1. **Programming Language**: Python
2. **Framework**: Langchain
3. **APIs**:
   - [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) for weather data.
   - ChatGroq for language model
